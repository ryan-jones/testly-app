# Testly App

This is a Nextjs project run with Firebase. Users can take publicly available tests for free, or they can create an account and build their own tests to share with others.

A deployed, working version of the app can be found [here](https://testly-8hbs8az3j-ryanllewellynjones-gmailcom.vercel.app/)
